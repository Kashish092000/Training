0,1351123200,B003XPF9BO,A3R7JR3FMEBXQB,5,where does one  start...and stop... with a treat like this,Wanted to save some to bring to my Chicago family but my North Carolina family ate all 4 boxes before I could pack. These are excellent...could serve to anyone
1,1351123200,B003JK537S,A3JBPC3WFUT5ZP,1,Arrived in pieces,"Not pleased at all. When I opened the box, most of the rings were broken in pieces. A total waste of money."
2,1351123200,B000JMBE7M,AQX1N6A51QOKG,4,"It isn't blanc mange, but isn't bad . . .","I'm not sure that custard is really custard without eggs.  But this comes close.  I got it for use in a ""Vegan pancake"" recipe.  We were having houseguests who were Vegan and I wanted to make some special breakfasts while they were here.  One of the cooking/recipe sites had a recipe using this and there were lots of great reviews.  I tried the recipe and it turned out like wallpaper paste -- yuck!<br />However, the  so-called custard isn't so bad.  I think it's probably just cornstarch and annatto (yellow coloring with a slight flavor).  It's fun playing with it.  You could dress it up with fruit.  Seems to come out on the thin side when you make it as directed, so I use less milk because I like my custards to set firm.  As a custard sauce it's fine.  I would say it tastes something between a pudding and a custard.<br /><br />If you want a really good egg-free ""custard"" get an original recipe for ""blanc mange.""  It takes a lot longer to make, but it's certainly worth the difference."
3,1351123200,B004AHGBX4,A2UY46X0OSNVUQ,3,These also have SALT and it's not sea salt.,"I like the fact that you can see what you're getting and that there are no bones or dark meat.  There are 7 nice big chunks in every jar.<br /><br />These taste like tuna in a can but, because they're preserved in glass, you don't have to worry about either aluminum or BPA; BUT ... they are not just tuna and spring water.<br /><br />There is salt in there, too, and it's not healthy sea salt, it's toxic table salt.<br /><br />I am trying to contact Tonnino to confirm that.  I might be wrong because the label states that the ingredients are ""tuna fish"" but the sticker on the top clarifies that it is the smaller (healthier) yellowfin, so the ""salt"" listed in the ingredients might be sea salt but, if it was, why don't they say so?<br /><br />Without confirmation, I will continue to look for a salt-free olive-oil free tuna preserved in glass.<br /><br />If you know of one, please contact me!"
4,1351123200,B001BORBHO,A1AFOYZ9HSM2CZ,5,Happy with the product,My dog was suffering with itchy skin.  He had been eating Natural Choice brand (cheaper) since he was a puppy.  I was nervous to change foods.  The vet suggested to change foods sand see if the skin issues cleared up.  Wellness brand did the job.  My dog seems to love the food and the skin issues cleared up within a few weeks.
5,1351123200,B008PSM0BQ,A3OUFIMGL2K6RS,4,Good Sauce,"This is a good all purpose sauce.  Has good flavor that the heat doesn't overpower.  Not really that spicy unless you use a whole bunch.  10 good drops is about enough to add a little heat to a pot of soup, but a lot more is needed if you want a lingering burn.  Heat isn't quite up to par with other products out there, (such as Spontaneous Combustion) but this has the true aged cayenne hot sauce flavor."
6,1351123200,B008YA1LQK,A9YEAAQVHFUTX,5,Blackcat,Great coffee!  Love all Green Mountain coffee and all the wonderful flavors.  Would and do recommend this coffee to all my friends.
7,1351123200,B001KP6B98,ABWCUS3HBDZRS,5,Excellent product,After scouring every store in town for orange peels and not finding anything satisfactory I turned to the online options.<br /><br /> I received the candied orange peels today and I found exactly what I was looking for. The peels are perfect for the fruit cake I plan to bake. The peels are not crystallized with sugar which is great  I like the texture and the taste of the peels and I am gonna order another box soon.
8,1351123200,B008YA1LQK,A2RSB6FVQ9K9OD,5,Bulk k-Cups,This is the best way to buy coffee for my office. Least expensive way to buy convenience with harder to find flavor and brand.  I also buy this way for home.
9,1351123200,B001E5E2QI,A23WYVBCNE75X1,3,It's Okay,"Next time, I will buy Gevalia Irish Cream decaf coffee.  I thought this would be as good, but it's mostly sugar."
10,1351123200,B000H9K4KA,A2WMZYYF8OSGD6,5,FABULOUS...,Absolutely wonderful.  A real licorice taste.  No phony baloney here!<br />It has a great flavor.  I'd purchase it again for sure.
11,1351123200,B004QDA8WC,ANM000BVVUSCT,5,"Exactly what I was looking for: Fast, fantastic Chai!","I was skeptical as to how good an all-in-one Chai Tea for Keurig could be, but my doubts were erased at my first sip!  The spice blend is great, as is the sweetening and the dairy component.  This is the kind of thing I was hoping I could get from my single-serve coffeemaker!<br /><br />Order some, you will thank yourself every time you brew a cup."
12,1351123200,B000K8T3OQ,AK43Y4WT6FFR3,1,Broken in a million pieces,"Chips were broken into small pieces. Problem isn't amazon's, it's Stacy's. Stacy (or amazon) needs to pack the original box of six better, the bags move around too much. There was room for at least two more bags in the box.<br />Amazon packed the Stacy's box in their box very tight and good.<br /><br />I tried to complain to Stacy, they make it very hard, no luck.<br />Chips taste great though, maybe I'll pour them in a bowl with milk for breakfast."
13,1351123200,B0051C0J6M,AWFA8N9IXELVH,1,Deceptive description,On Oct 9 I ordered from a different vendor the same product 1.2 oz- 6 pack.  That order was 6 packs of 1.2 oz ea.  When I saw this item I decided to order it.  it read the same as my first order 1.2 oz- 6 pack & the price was approximately the same.  I received the order today & what is it but 1 large bag of small packs totaling 1.2 oz.  I call this deceptive not curious as another reviewer put it. I think the descriptions should be more specfic. The 1 star rating I gave is because of the description not the product itself.  The chips are actually very good.
14,1351123200,B0051C0J6M,AG4YGLLIE8BWP,5,Makes me drool just thinking of them,"The Brit's have out done us. The flavor is supreme,they satisfy my hunger for steak and onions...<br />Get them while you can...  Their other flavors are great tooo"
15,1351123200,B003J9HAU2,A23WYVBCNE75X1,3,it's alright,My kitten prefers Kitten Chow or Iams.  He leaves it in his bowl unlike other brands I have purchased in the past.
16,1351123200,B001444G5Q,A3FIA99WOIL40T,2,these are mini candy bars.,I was very disappointed with this order because no where on the description did it say that these were mini candy bars. If you don't want mini's DO NOT BY THIS PACKAGE!!!! Now I have to spend more money because it would cost a ton of money to send these back and I'm not going to give out mini's to trick or treaters.
17,1351123200,B006Q7YG24,A7EU2BWLLCJY2,5,My dogs love them!,"I've tried several different kinds of freeze-dried chicken treats and, for the most part, they are all so dehydrated that they literally turn into dust in the bag.  You get a couple of solid pieces out of a bag, then the rest you have to sprinkle on top of dog food because it's just chicken powder.  These don't do that!  They have some additional ingredients in them besides chicken (veggies and fruit mostly) so they stay together very nicely.  They are definitely designed for larger dogs - each treat is about the size of a fifty-cent piece (when was the last time you saw one of those?) and about a quarter to a half an inch thick.  But they break easily into smaller pieces for little dogs.  I have teeny, tiny chihuahuas so I have to break these treats into M&M-sized pieces for them, but they can't get enough!  And the bag goes a long ways if you are breaking them down into smaller treats.  These are now permanently on my shopping list for my babies."
18,1351123200,B008JKSJJ2,A1XV4W7JWX341C,5,"Loved these gluten free healthy bars, saved $$ ordering on Amazon",These Kind Bars are so good and healthy & gluten free.  My daughter came across them and loves them for a quick snack between her hectic schedule of classes & work. Most times she won't have time to eat a full meal and these are such a great alternative to fast food.  I will order again & this time I'll get a few for moi! Really loved the coconut too..
19,1351123200,B008JKSJJ2,A34XBAIFT02B60,1,Should advertise coconut as an ingredient more prominently,"First, these should be called Mac - Coconut bars, as Coconut is the #2 ingredient and Mango is #3.  Second, lots of people don't like coconut.  I happen to be allergic to it.  Word to Amazon that if you want happy customers to make things like this more prominent.  Thanks."
